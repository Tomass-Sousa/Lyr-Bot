# Maid-Bot

A discord bot I made 3 years ago with a friend, this projet made us try and learn so many things.

It was not easy to host this bot and we had lots of crashes, but this was the final version, who's still working on heroku. 

Sometimes I like to look what we made, and decided to make this code public just for fun, the notes are in french, but you can pretty much understand what we made by looking the code.

It's amazing what we can do even at a young age, it was not even that useful but we enjoyed every step of this small project.
